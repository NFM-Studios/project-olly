# Installation

1. Clone the repository! You need the code, it won't just magically work without it. `git clone https://github.com/NFM-Studios/project-olly.git`
2. Install docker and docker-compose. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit using the guidance in the file
4. Copy `Caddyfile.example` to `Caddyfile` and change `example.com` to your domain and `email.example.com` to your email address
5. Run `docker-compose up -d`
6. A user was automatically created with the username `admin` and the password `ChangeMe!` **DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD!**
7. How easy was that!?

# Designs and Template
Project Olly allows you to throw in your front end templates without having to mess with any backend code! It's simple!

Use our templates in project-templates as a base, then set `template_path` in `.env` to wherever you stored your custom templates
